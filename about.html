	<p>i’m kind of quirky. kind of really quirky. if you don’t find these quirks of mine endearing then i will probably get on your nerves</p>

<p>things i like: floaty pens, rock pencils, museums, view master slides, smashed pennies, snow globes, building stuff , coffee first thing in the morning and sparkling water (that beverage is way underrated)</p>

<p>things i love: the color silver, monkeys, weird museums & thinking about going to space</p>
<p>things i don't like: when i tell people i’m a photographer & they tell me where i should go photograph, religious or political discussions with more than 3 people, fast food, reality tv and people touching my computer screen</p>

<p>i tend to operate best in overdrive. usually i’m juggling 2-3 photo projects, doing some house repair something or another,  & my 15 year-old daughter’s full schedule. i’m a pretty busy person. i like it that way...most of the time</p>

<p>if you need the official scoop you can look at my resume or ask me a question.</p>
